My friend, Remi, loves making art, especially for games. I love making games, and have no interest in making art. When I found out Remi had learned how to 3D model at his school, I was ecstatic. Over the summer while he was home, we created a game called “Go,” where the object is for a pufferfish named Buster (the player) to escape a maze-like sewer system. This sewer is occupied by a kind and reasonable fish named Leonard who doesn't want to eat Buster, but he has to so that he can prove his dominance in the sewer. Your job as Buster is to escape the sewer before Leonard, who repeatedly apologizes to Buster why he must eat him throughout the chase.
 
Remi and I pulled all-nighters several times to finish this game. It is essentially complete, although it lacks a main menu and an actual winning condition if Buster is able to escape.
 
 
 
I was unable to upload this project onto GitHub because the files are too big, but I’ve included the files in this Google drive folder so you can play the game by using this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YDLn0IDUcLHClIp1ChWNYe_J7e5708CF?usp=sharing
