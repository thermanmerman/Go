I have a friend that loves making things just as much as I do, so when I found out that he learned how to 3D model at his school (a skill I am severely lacking in), I was ecstatic. Every now and then over the summer, we would get together and stay up all night trying to finish a game. Our restriction was that it had to rhyme with the word "throw" as that was the title of the first game we attempted to make and we thought it would be funny if they all rhymed. This project was the closest we got. 

In it, you play as a pufferfish named Buster who has found himself in a maze-like sewer system. This sewer is occupied by a kind and reasonable fish named Leonard who doesn't want to eat you, but has to so that he can prove his dominance over the sewer. Your job as Buster is to escape the sewer before Leonard tracks you through his sewer and eats you.

The game is mostly finished however it lacks some crucial things that are typically required to constitute as an actual game such as a main menu and an actual finish to the game because as of right now, you just escape the maze and fall into a boundless void of nothing.



I was unable to get this project onto github because it's complicated and scary, and the files were too big, so if you want to see all the files for this project and maybe play it for yourself, kindly follow this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YDLn0IDUcLHClIp1ChWNYe_J7e5708CF?usp=sharing
