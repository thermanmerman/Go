My friend, Remi, loves making art, especially for games. I love making games, and hate making art. So when I found out he’d learned how to 3D model at his school, I was ecstatic. Over the summer while he was home, we created a game called “Go,” where the object is for a pufferfish named Buster (the player) to escape a maze-like sewer system. This sewer is occupied by a kind and reasonable fish named Leonard who doesn't want to eat Buster, but he has to so that he can prove his dominance in the sewer. Your job as Buster is to escape the sewer before Leonard, who repeatedly apologizes to Buster why he must eat him throughout the chase.
 
To create another challenge for designing the game, we decided that it had to rhyme with the word "throw" as that was the title of the first game we attempted to make and we thought it would be funny if they all rhymed. We would come up with a word that rhymed, and then try and make a game that related to that word. This project was the closest we got to finishing one. 
 
Remi and I pulled all-nighters several times to finish this game. It is essentially complete, although it lacks a main menu and an actual finish because if Buster is able to escape, there is no defined location that he arrives at.
 
 
 
I was unable to upload this project onto github because the files are too big, but I’ve included the files in this Google drive folder so you can play the game by using this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YDLn0IDUcLHClIp1ChWNYe_J7e5708CF?usp=sharing
